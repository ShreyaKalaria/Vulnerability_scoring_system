# Vulnerability Scoring System
This is a project I have developed for academic purpose (Software Project Lab 3). The purpose of this software is to collect up-to-date vulnerability dataset. The dataset includes CVE-ID, Description, Exploit-DB links, CVSS and EPSS scores and much more.

At the time of writing there is 1,90,799 CVE data available on this software (upper right corner). Users can navigate to all datasets using the bottom buttons. Also double click an item will trigger a detailed view of each CVE.

Using Bert classifier this software can predict an unknown CVSS scores from its description.
This software also capable of showing different graphical exhibition that can be triggered from exhibition | graphical action.

Figures shows the overall trends of vulnerability. Also users can view vendor wise comparison graph and top affected product pie charts.

CVSS3.1 calculator has been implemented here. Which can be triggered from calculator | CVSS action

Lastly users can manually update the vulnerability dataset and also export the underlying dataset for their further analysis / research.
