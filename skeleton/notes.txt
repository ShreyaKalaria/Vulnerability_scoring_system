ui_file used by same type py file and load("ui.ui")

	1. So ui file basically replace traditional init() functions just.
	2. It is dynamic because when designing ui_file we do not need to specify the actual class who will instantiate it.
		but we have to specify the type(QWidget)

ui_component using promote:
	1. Promote is basically a way to add new feature(class) to existing class like inheritance.
	2. For ui persepective: some custome design is not readily available on designer. so we can define a placeholder(QFrame)
	   and specify the actual python file responsible for generating that custom design and additional functionality.
	3. Here, py file uses init() from constructor to populate its custom design. init() will define a new QWidget to customize
		event listener e.t.c then set it as central widget of QFrame.
	4. We must specify the ui_component who is the file(in header file) and who is the class responsible for promote
	5. example: chart.py(promoted QFrame with custom design and new functionality),
				table.py(promoted existing QTableWidget with new functionality)
